    <p> How does it work?<br><br>


The Merchant process a sale including accepting payment.<br>

The Merchant sends WebPicID the buyer information and the total amount of the sale.<br>

(Use the same software for the payment post without the card info.)<br>

Tell the buyer:<br>

“We protect you from identity theft losses by verifying your identity at WebPicID.com.”<br>

“Press here to continue to WebPicID.com or find the site via a web browser.”<br>

Wait for WebPicID to respond before releasing the goods or services.<br>

There are 4 possible responses: All lead to a reduction in fraud losses for both parties.<br>

Authorization<br>

WebPicID advises that the buyer verified their identity and authorized the sale.<br>

Declined<br>

WebPicID advises that the buyer verified their identity and declined the sale.<br>

Ignored<br>

WebPicID advises that the buyer HAS NOT verified their identity or responded.<br>

Fraud<br>

WebPicID advises that the buyer verified their identity and declined the sale as a Fraud.<br>


In all cases there was no loss to either party.<br>


What happens in all these cases?<br>

The goods are released when the sale is authorized.<br>

A declined sale is canceled.<br>

The ignored sale will sit until it is resolved or canceled.<br>

Sooner or later someone will notice that they have a charge on their card and call.<br>

Reminders can be sent at regular intervals.<br>

The Fraud notification generates a report for the victim.<br>

The sale is canceled and the card company is notified about the fraud by the Merchant.<br>

The card information is never released to WebPicID or the party declaring a fraud.<br><br>


There is no fee to check each sale.
